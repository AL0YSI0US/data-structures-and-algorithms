## üìö My Personal User Story

+ As a user I want to be able to read code so that I can interpret if bias is present.
+ As a user I want to be able to hold individuals/ organizations accountable should the need arise for someone or a group to be represented.
+ As a user I want to be able to leverage the hard skills I have obtained in an effort to provide services to my community members sans capitalism and all it's absurd nuances.
+ As a user I wasnt to be able to create content that considers accessibility at every turn.
+ As a user I want to leverage the tools the web offers to spread neurodiversity awareness.
+ As a user I want a toolkit of skills curated so that I may create across technological mediums...to my heart's content.
+ As a user I want to be able to *"grab the things*" and *"move the things around*" as it pertains to the mysterious artform called CSS.

### üåê R E S O U R C E S

+ **Code challenge** [setup instructions](https://codefellows.github.io/setup-guide/code-301/3-code-challenges) üõ†Ô∏è
+ **.gitignore**

### üë• C O L L A B O R A T O R S

+ TA Bryant helped me comprehend code and logic during Code Challenge 1. After his assistace I had a better plan of attack for the whiteboard process of approaching each question.
+ Garfield gave me a run down of how he was able to make sense of his logic which was helpful for filling in some gaps so I could attempt the stretch goal on Code Challenge 1. I knew `===` was needed somewhere, and remebered using ` % ` (modulus) before but based on many resources I could not figure out how to apply these bits to my code base. {I also pulled the test code out so I could experience all the delight of green checks everywhere in my terminal on my final tests}

### ü§î R E F L E C T I O N S

+ It keeps me awake wonderin'...what is it that is manipulating the color behavoir of  the "`( (( ))`" parenthesis in VS code? Depending on where I place them, and how many (but specifically where) they change color almost as if they comprehend the data they are containing and have a specific set of rules they are abiding by. What sort of JS magik is at play here???

### ‚ù§Ô∏è G R A T T I T U D E

+ Props to Daniel for his patience and dilligent articulations of the JavaScript he comprehends! It's a pleasure to listen to him explain things.
+ Props to Ta Bryant for helping me get one step closer to nailing down how to confidently use `console.log()` statements to test the codebases I'm working with. I have been waiting for this light bulb to flicker on for a hot minute! I'm catching flickers of light from over here in the dark non-traditional coding abyss-Thank you!!!
